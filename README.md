# About the Hero Section of My Electric Vehicle Website
I have created an engaging hero section for an electric vehicle website, designed to captivate visitors with dynamic content and multimedia elements. Here are the key features of this hero section:

## Key Features
<b>1. Automatic Image and Content Rotation:</b>

The hero section showcases various images and content related to electric vehicles.
The images and accompanying text automatically change every 3 seconds, providing a visually appealing and informative experience.

<b>2. Interactive Video Element:</b>

• A button is included in the hero section that, when clicked, plays a video directly within the section.

• This feature allows users to watch engaging video content without navigating away from the hero section.

### Technical Implementation
<b>1. Image and Content Rotation:</b>

• Implemented using React.js with a state management technique that updates the displayed image and content every 3 seconds.

• Utilizes setInterval to cycle through an array of images and content.

<b>2. Video Integration:</b>

• A video element is embedded in the hero section.

• An onClick event handler is attached to the button, which triggers the video playback.

• The video is set to autoplay and display in the same area as the rotating images when activated.
